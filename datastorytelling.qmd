[While storyboarding, make your story points with attributes from the *right* side.]{style='color:red;'}

## Storyframing before {.smaller}

- Before you communicate insight, you must find one!
- Focus on key dimensions and find key metrics

# Storyboarding Activity

## Storyboarding {.smaller}

- Definition: A **story** is an account of causally related or connected series of events.
- A narrative always has a one-dimensional **linear sequence**, but we can decide 
  - what is in and 
  - in which order.
- **Storyboarding** is a technique from the movie industry (invented at Disney's in the 30's, now part of pre-visualization) which can also be used for data presentations. 
- Main purpose: [**Build the story, not the exact visualizations (rough ideas are enough)!**]{style='color:blue;'}

[Activity:]{style='color:red;'} Make a story board for your presentation. Follow the steps on the next slides. 


## Phase A: Story points! {.smaller}

[Activity]{style='color:red;'}

1. Write down **story points** and/or brief visual sketches on sticky notes or cards.
    - There is no limit on the initial number of story-point card to generate!
    - **Select the best 6 to 10 ones**
    - Keep all, maybe you want to replace one 
    - You can always create or refine one later

2. Already now you can play with your story points to search for a **compelling story**.
  - Arrange them in order
  - Replace, combine, refine, and reshuffle them
  - Use them to tell the story
  - Scrutinize and iterate your story


## Phase B: Storyboarding! {.smaller}

[Activity:]{style='color:red;'} Realize these steps in your storyboard. 

- Step 1: Identify your **"Aha" moment** (main insight)
- Step 2: Find your beginning (the **setting** and the **"hook"**)
- Step 3: Select your **rising insights** (narrative from the hook to the Aha moment)
- Step 4: **Conclude** with solutions, next steps, empowerment to action, ...


When your storyboard is fixed 

- write the titles down in your slide deck and 
- start working on your final visuals such that they best support your story.
