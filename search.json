That means the source code must be provided.\nHowever, the report must be readable without reading code. The target audience is not a programmer and they should not see code while reading. Technical parts should be in the appendix. \nDelivery via GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou can make your data story into a nice thing to show your competence to the outside world.

    "section": "10 Artifical Intelligence (AI) Use Policy",
    "text": "10 Artifical Intelligence (AI) Use Policy\nThis policy covers any generative AI tool, such as ChatGPT, Elicit, etc. This includes text, code, slides, artwork/graphics/video/audio and other products.\nWe instructors encouraged to using and exploring AI tools for these purposes:\n\nLearning by dialog with a chatbot. AI chatbots can be very helpful to explain you concepts on your desired level and get a feeling about how certain topics are treated. You can ask for an easier or more detailed explanation or focus on certain aspects. Note: The capabilities are limited and you likely receive a lot of false information! An AI chat can be a good entry point to learn about a specific topic but the more specific it gets the more likely it is that AI will start to deliver useless or wrong answers. Using chatbots should remain a small part of your learning process. Rule of thumb: Spend not more than 25% of the learning time with chatting. There is no way around reading textbooks, reading software documentation, learning and understanding concepts, searching for help online, asking instructors or fellow students.\nHave code snippets written. Tools like GitHub Copilot can be a great help in coding! You are encouraged to have them available and try them. The GitHub Copilot is free to use for students and teachers who joined GitHub Education), they can be integrated in your programming IDE like RStudio and VSCode. Copilots can speed up writing. However, they may deliver bad code. There is no way around understanding yourself what code is doing! Do not spend endless hours asking for new code with new prompts, spend time understanding a language and the functions and objects you are using! AI chatbots and Copilots can also help you to understand code. Copilots can be a great help to get a skeleton of code and an idea how your solution might look, they rarely deliver the complete code, expect that the code does not work, expect that the code seems to works but the results are wrong. You are 100% accountable for the code you produce, with or without the help of a copilot!\nHave a draft text snippet written. Formulating and describing research questions, describing data, documenting code, interpreting results, and deriving conclusion form the results is an essential part of data science not direclty related to coding but verbal text. Chatbots are good in writing text which often appears as well readable. You can use this to inspire you and to polish and improve your texts. However, you are 100% accountable for the text you deliver. You are expected to know what your text is about and to be able to answer questions about what your text means! With text generated purely by chatbots, it is oftenn evident for us that students do not understand. We consider such cases worse than incomplete but sensible self-written text. Text written by chatbots is often very generic and not specific. In general, we value more specific text higher than generic text. Large parts of very generic text is considered worse than a shorter more specific text.\nNote: Philosophical and legal questions around the training and use of chatbots and code copilots are controversially contested and re-examined constantly! We encourage to engage with such questions and become aware of arguments and debates.\n\nIf any part of this AI policy is confusing or uncertain, please reach out to us for a conversation before submitting your work.",

Add any restriction you have in the reply on Teams.\n\n\n\n\n2 Topics\n\n\nVisualization and comparison of distributions of numerical variables (Boxplots, Violin Plots, Histograms, Density plots, Ridgeline plots) (Inspiration from the stories https://www.data-to-viz.com/story/OneNum.html, https://www.data-to-viz.com/story/OneNumOneCatSeveralObs.html, and https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/boxplot.html)\nVisualization of one categorical variable or nested categorical variables (Barplots and Lollipops and versions of stacking and dodging, Pie charts, Treemaps, Word Clouds) (Inspiration from the stories https://www.data-to-viz.com/story/OneNumOneCat.html, https://www.data-to-viz.com/story/SevCatOneNumNestedOneObsPerGroup.html, https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/multi_distribution.html, and https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/pie.html)\nVisualization of two or three numerical variables (Scatter plots, Scatter plots with summary statistics - regression or loess, the overplotting problem, density and contour plots, What can be used for the thrid variable – size, color, …?) (Inspiration from the stories https://www.data-to-viz.com/story/TwoNum.html and https://www.data-to-viz.com/story/ThreeNum.html)\nTwo numerical variables where one is ordered (e.g. time) and an additional categorical one (Line plots, Area plots, Focusing, the Spaghetti plot problem) (Inspiration from the stories https://www.data-to-viz.com/story/TwoNumOrdered.html, https://www.data-to-viz.com/story/OneCatSevOrderedNum.html, and https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/spaghetti.html)\n\nOptional topics:\n\nDendro grams (Hierarchical Clustering)\nNetworks (Inspiration from https://www.data-to-viz.com/story/AdjacencyMatrix.html)\nMaps (Inspiration from https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/choropleth.html, https://www.data-to-viz.com/story/GPSCoordWithoutValue.html, and https://www.data-to-viz.com/story/GPSCoordWithValue.html)\nInteractive graphs (plotly, shiny, or observable)\nTableau and Power BI\n\n\nGenerally, for all specific visualization there is more information on https://datavizcatalogue.com and https://www.data-to-viz.com.\n\n\n3 Structure and Format\nStructure of the student presentation:\n\nExplain the underlying visualization task\nProvide examples of solutions using different data sources\nCompare different solutions with the same data\nFinish with a summary about good and bad uses for the visualization type, common problems, do’s and don’ts\n\nFormat:\n\nProvide a “hands-on” document where code and data is provided which produce visualizations. It can be a markdown or notebook file in which you mix text and code or a raw script where you put some descriptive text in comments. It can be in R or python. (If you want to use something else please coordinate before.) A repository in the organization https://github.com/JU-F22-MDSSB-MET-03 can be provided for distribution to others. Contact me on Teams. Students will then be enabled to clone it and play with the code.\nYou do not need presentation slides but you can. You can use revealjs in quarto to nicely present code and visualizations.\n\n\n\n4 Help\nWrite any clarification questions to me on Teams."
