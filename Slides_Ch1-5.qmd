# Chapter 1: Driving Change through Insight 

## Section Headlines of Chapter 1{.smaller}

- Why Change Is Important
- Everyone Becomes an Analyst
- Data Literacy Is Essential in Today’s Data Economy
- What Is an Insight?
- Effective Communication Turns Insights into Actions
- Data-driven Change Isn’t Easy
- Strive to Communicate, Not Just Inform
- Telling the Story of Your Data


## Data Literacy {.smaller}

**Definition:** The ability to understand and communicate data.

- Data has no value for data illiterate people!
- People can be data literate with knowing much statistics or even programming!
- As data scientists we are expected to
    - know some statistics and programming
    - communicate data insights on a high level to data literate people
    - being able to communicate data insights to less data illiterate people

. . . 

**The challenges for your project: **

- [Bring you main insights across to an audience with low and intermediate data literacy!]{style='color:blue;'}

## What is an **insight**? {.smaller}

**Etymology:** "inner sight" or “  sight with the ‘eyes’ of the mind”

**A Definition:** an unexpected shift in the way we understand things

However: Do not feel pressured! The insight need not be ground breaking.

. . . 

[**Activity**]{style='color:red;'}

**What can be main insights of your project presentation?**

1. List at least 3 potential main insights, better more   
(It's okay if the insights are uncertain for now because you do not know yet)
2. Discuss for each project in your group and select a *tentative* main insight (not binding)  
Role of other project members: 
    - Ask questions 
    - What is important to know as an outsider? 
    - What is most interesting as main insight?
 

## Which perspective of communication shall the project have? {.smaller}

You can communicate to the audience from the position of an

<!-- Personal ![](img/dykes/relationshipinsight_personal.png)  -->
![](img/dykes/relationshipinsight_insider.png) **Insider**

or

# Chapter 2: Why Tell Stories with Data?

## 3 Essential Elements of Data Stories {.smaller}

[**Data, Visuals, Narrative**]{style='color:blue;'}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='33%'}
The three essential elements of data stories.

![](img/dykes/datanarrativesvisuals.png)
:::

::: {.column width='65%'}
- [**Explain.**]{style='color:blue;'} Narrative coupled with data. 
  - What's happening in the data? 
  - What is the context?
  - Guide through the data structure!
  - Why is a particular insight important? 
- [**Enlighten.**]{style='color:blue;'} Visuals applied to data. 
  - Some insights are hard with numbers only. 
  - Show patterns and outliers otherwise hidden. 
- [**Engage.**]{style='color:blue;'} Narrative and visuals merged together. 
  - Engage (or even entertain) an audience. 
  - Visuals capture interest, only a story holds attention.

::: {.column width='50%'}

- **Ethos** an appeal to credibility
- **Logos** an appeal to logic or reason
- **Pathos** an appeal to emotion
- *Telos* an appeal to purpose
- *Kairos* an appeal to timeliness (opportune moment)

[**Activity: **]{style='color:red;'}

Check your potential story:   
Can you address all these 5 rhetoric perspectives?

  - Show credibility by not telling stories unrelated to data. 
  - What parts appeal to emotion, do you want to emphasize it, to make it relatable?
  - Do you have logical reasoning for your main point?
  - Can you make reference to timeliness.
  - What is the main purpose of the story?

## Talking Point {.smaller}

Some quotes:

- *Sometimes reality is too complex. Stories give it form.*
- *Storytelling is the most powerful way to put ideas into the world today.*
- *Stories change people while statistics give them something to argue about.*

. . . 

Questions for discussion:

- [Is Storytelling just about persuasion like advertising?]{style='color:blue;'}

- [Should we do this as Data Scientists?]{style='color:blue;'}

- [Isn't Data Science largely about fighting against wrong but compelling stories?]{style='color:blue;'}

## Data Story Continuum {.smaller}


![](img/dykes/datastorycontinuum.png)

. . . 

Five *contrasting* attribute pairs.   
[Try to bring visuals and story point to have attributes from the right!]{style="color:blue;"}


## Storyframing before Storytelling {.smaller}

- Before you communicate insight, you must find one!
- Focus on key metrics and dimensions

![](img/dykes/storyframing_vs_storytelling.png)

. . . 

[**Activity: **]{style='color:red;'} Note potential key metrics in your data to frame your story. 


## Anatomy of a Data Story {.smaller}

![](img/dykes/storyformat.png)

. . . 

**Different structure for two parts of your report**

- [Narrative structure for your **slide deck and presentation**]{style='color:blue;'}
- Inverted pyramid structure for the **written report**

## Six essential elements of data stories {.smaller}

![](img/dykes/datastories_six_elements.png)

- [Your **project slide deck and presentation** matches a **Data Presentation**]{style='color:blue;'}
- [Your **project  report** matches a **Curated Report (and Dashboard)**]{style='color:blue;'}

## Differences in Communication {.smaller}

![](img/dykes/direct_vs_indirect_comm.png)

- [Your **project slide deck and presentation** is direct communication]{style='color:blue;'}
- [Your **project  report** is indirect communication]{style='color:blue;'}


# Chapter 5: Data, The Foundation of Your Data Story

## From Exploration to Explanation {.smaller}

[Your new challenge: Come from explorattion to explanation!]{style="color:blue;"}

![](img/dykes/explore_explain.png)

. . . 

Once a meaningful insight is uncovered, *explanatory* data visualization shall be produced to tell the the story.


## Exploratory vs. Explanatory {.smaller}


|  | Exploratory | Explanatory |
|--|:----------:|:-----------:|
| *Goal*  | Understand  | Communicate |
| *Audience* | You | Other people |
| *Data familiarity* | Very familiar (you) | Less familiar (others) |
| *Visualization focus* | Flexibility and speed | Simplicity, clarity, and cohesion |
| *Narrative* | Unknown | Known |
| *Outcome* | Insight | Action |
